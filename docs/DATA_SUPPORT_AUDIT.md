# Data and model support audit

Verified against the public Paper Schema API implementation and contracts on
2026-07-27.

## Directly supported by Sciverse data

| Product capability | Public source | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paper discovery | `POST /paper-schema/search` | English keyword and metadata matching over the current 1M+ AI conference-paper corpus. |
| Paper entities | `GET /paper-schema/schemas/{schema_id}/entities` | Paper-scoped extracted Entity nodes; absence is displayed as absence and is not synthesized. |
| Internal graph | `POST /paper-schema/relations/search` | Relations between Entity nodes inside a known paper only. |
| Complete outbound references | `GET /paper-schema/schemas/{schema_id}/citations` | Keeps unresolved references; only resolved items can open another Schema paper. |
| Citation graph | `GET /paper-schema/schemas/{schema_id}/citation-graph` | Contains only references resolved to Schema paper IDs in the current corpus. |
| Related papers | `POST /paper-schema/schemas/{schema_id}/related-papers` | Ranked suggestions from Entity, Term and Citation signals; suggestions are not factual edges. |
| Evidence | `POST /paper-schema/evidence/search` | Uses public groups such as `resource`, `formula`, `citation_signal`, `reference_semantics`, `table_evidence` and `comparison_detail`. |
| Paragraph trace | `POST /paper-schema/resolve-provenance` | Uses exactly one locator mode: paragraph IDs, or schema ID plus marker numbers. |

## Model participation

### Query planning

Chinese and long natural-language questions are rewritten into one to three
short English search phrases. This is necessary for reliable recall because
the indexed source text is predominantly English. FrontierLens therefore
requires a configured and enabled model before starting exploration.
The local glossary is not exposed as a successful no-model operating mode.

### Research guide

The model may order and explain only papers already present in the assembled
session graph. Returned Schema IDs are validated against that graph. If the
model request fails or returns invalid structured output, the current task
fails explicitly and no guide or overview is substituted.

The reading order, stage labels and narrative summary are product-level
derivations. They are not fields returned by Sciverse and must not be presented
as extracted facts or a factual research chronology.

The user may explicitly request Chinese or English Guide/Roadmap output. This is
a presentation preference, not source-data translation. Paper titles, Entity
labels, Evidence, and provenance remain unchanged.

### Deliberately not delegated to the model

- Entity and relation extraction
- Citation resolution or edge creation
- Evidence values and paragraph text
- Paper IDs, titles and bibliographic metadata
- Empty-result interpretation

## Not supported as direct data capabilities

- General Chinese full-text retrieval without query translation
- Automatic Chinese translation of paper titles, abstracts, Entity labels or
  evidence text
- Coverage outside the current completed Paper Schema corpus
- A citation edge for an unresolved reference
- A globally canonical Entity identity across different papers; Entity IDs are
  paper-scoped extraction identities
- A factual reading order, roadmap or topic chronology
- A complete long-form Chinese paper summary from a single upstream response
- Claims that an empty result means the research does not exist
- A complete global knowledge graph assembled without query and size limits

## Corrections made during this audit

- Replaced obsolete internal Evidence group names with the public API groups.
- Made provenance locator modes mutually exclusive.
- Added support for public `paragraph_ids` and `§N` marker provenance.
- Removed synthetic Problem and Method nodes when Entity data is absent.
- Replaced the former synthetic opening data with a live bounded discovery map.
- Replaced obsolete UI Entity categories with the public taxonomy.
- Marked paper reading as Schema-structured rather than falsely claiming model
  generation.
- Added a persistent Chinese/English presentation preference while preserving
  source-language facts.
- Replaced static decorative overview circles with data-driven semantic
  clusters and added bounded seed-paper Entity/Relation expansion.
